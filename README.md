> :warning: **This project is not completed and still under active development**

This is a work in progress matching decompilation of Sonic Advance 2

It so far builds the following ROMs:
* [**sa2.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=0890) `sha1: 7bcd6a07af7c894746fa28073fe0c0e34408022d` (USA) (En,Ja,Fr,De,Es,It)
* [**sa2_europe.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=0900) `sha1: b0f64bdca097f2de8f05ac4c8caea2b80c5faeb1` (Europe) (En,Ja,Fr,De,Es,It)
* :construction: [**sa2_japan.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=0799) `sha1: dffd0188fc78154b42b401398a224ae0713edf23` (Japan) (En,Ja,Fr,De,Es,It) (Work in Progress)

It can also build:
* **sa2.sdl** `make sdl` (Linux/MacOS SDL 64bit port)
* **sa2.sdl_win32.exe** `make sdl_win32` (Windows SDL 64bit port)
* :construction: **sa2.win32.exe** `make win32` (Win32 native port, not functional)

## Current state

- :tada: The build is 100% from C files with [~80 functions which currently don't match](./asm/non_matching)
- All assembly code extracted, disassembled, and decompiled by hand to their C equivilent
- All songs have been extracted, and documented as [matching MIDI files](./sound/songs/midi)
- All sprite animation frames have been [extracted to PNGs and are used to build the matching rom](./graphics/obj_tiles)
- All tilemaps (backgrounds) have been documented and [had their tiles extracted](./data/tilemaps)
- The game compiles to a widescreen port (*426x240*) for multiple platforms
- The "sub games" (Chao Garden and Collect The Rings) have been disassembled but not yet decompiled

## Notes

- The [Kirby & The Amazing Mirror](https://github.com/jiangzhengwenjz/katam/) decompilation uses a very similar codebase, as it was written by the same dev team (Dimps)
- https://decomp.me is a great resource for helping to create matching functions
- `ldscript.txt` tells the linker the order which files should be linked
- For more info, see the [FAQs section](https://zelda64.dev/games/tmc) of TMC
