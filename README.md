This is a work in progress matching decompilation of Sonic Advance 2

It so far builds the following ROM:
* [**sa2.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=0890) `sha1: 7bcd6a07af7c894746fa28073fe0c0e34408022d`

### Current state

- Assembly code [extracted, disassembled, and somewhat categorised](./asm/)
- All libraries decompiled to C or referenced from `agbcc`
- Initialisation of game state, main task logic, save game logic, UI, Multiplayer code, Special Stage
- All songs have been extracted, and documented as [matching MIDI files](./sound/songs/midi)
- :warning: The build is not yet shiftable, meaning all significant code modifications will cause the rom to crash

### Setting up the repository

**Provide assets**

You must have a copy of the Sonic Advance 2 (USA) ROM named `baserom.gba` in the repository directory.


**Dev container**

If you use `vscode` then consider using the provided [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) which skips the requirement for any setup.


**Install build requirements** *(without dev container)*
 
On Linux systems
```
sudo apt install binutils-arm-none-eabi gcc-arm-none-eabi libpng-dev
```

On MacOS and Windows install [**devkitARM**](http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitARM)

**Install `agbcc` into the repo**

Clone the [agbcc](https://github.com/pret/agbcc) repo into another folder

Inside the `agbcc` repo and run `./build.sh` and then install the compiler in this repo `./install.sh path/to/sa2`

**Build the rom**

On Linux and MacOS, run `make` in the root of the repo to build.

On Windows you can build using `make` in the MSYS environment provided with devkitARM.

This command will also build all the required tooling in the `tools` directory. 
The `tools` directory contains a bunch of tooling (built by [pret](https://github.com/pret)) which is used to build assets and create a matching rom.

If the rom built successfully you will see this output

```bash
sa2.gba: OK
```

### Code formatting

All C code in this repo is formatted with `clang-format-13`. If using the Dev Container this is installed automatically.

To format code run `make format`

### Notes

- The [Kirby & The Amazing Mirror](https://github.com/jiangzhengwenjz/katam/) decompilation uses a very similar codebase, as it was written by the same dev team (Dimps)
- https://decomp.me is a great resource for helping to create matching functions
- `ldscript.txt` tells the linker the order which files should be linked
- For more info, see the [FAQs section](https://zelda64.dev/games/tmc) of TMC
