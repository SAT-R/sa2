@; TODO(Jace):
@; - Find out what the remaining AnimCmds do (some might have been for debugging?)
@; - calculate GetTileIndex indices by using the actual graphics' pointers, not hardcoded values
@; - do JumpBack calls relatively, not with hardcoded numbers

@ The default behavior of some commands (when AnimCmd_6 didn't squeeze itself inbetween):
@ AnimCmd_GetTileIndex:    (u32)<Tile Index> (u32)<numTilesToCopy> (u32)<unk0> (u32)<unk1>
@ AnimCmd_GetPalette:      (u32)<Palette ID> (u16)<numColorsToCopy> (u16)<insertOffset>
@ AnimCmd_PlaySoundEffect: (u32)<SongID> (u32)<unk0> (u32)<unk1>

@ AnimCmd_JumpBack:        (u32)<backIndex>
@    Basically each sprite has a "animation progress cursor" (a u16).
@    That cursor gets multiplied by sizeof(s32) and added to the base address of the animation variant.
@    When the game reaches a 'AnimCmd_JumpBack', the index is on that very command-indicating address.
@    So the parameter 'backIndex' makes the cursor go back that address by 4*backIndex, by simply subtracting from it.

@ AnimCmd_SetAnimIdAndVariant:               (u16)<animId> (u16)<variant>
